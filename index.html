    <h1>The end of the course</h1>
    <p>This is the end of the material for the Tools for CS studies course.</p>
    <p>Take a break, and congratulate yourself for finishing reading the material. Then go back to the learning goals you can find from the beginning of this part, and see which subjects seem unclear to you. If you have trouble remembering something, check the material or the Internet for answers.</p>
    <p>Finally, make sure to read the exam instructions before starting. Also remember to mark all the exercises you have done on Moodle, so we can use them in grading, and that you have enrolled on the course in Weboodi.</p>
